## About me
I am an ecologist who's broadly interested in mycorrhizas, global change, and socio-ecological systems. I currently have projects in rural areas across the US, a natural ecological gradient in western Greenland, and community gardens in Boston, MA. My dream job is to be a part of interdisciplinary teams that are focused on solving socio-environmental issues. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, spending time outside, and hanging out with my sassy Australian Cattle Dog.

## Background
**PhD** in Ecology, Evolution, Environment and Society - Dartmouth College, in progress! <br/>
**MS** in Forestry and Natural Resources - Purdue University, 2021 <br/>
**BS** in Environmental Science - University of Vermont, 2017

## Projects
### 1. Small mammal-mediated dispersal of soil fungi
I leverage National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) biorepository collections and field data to study soil fungi dispersed by small mammals at 18 sites across the US. Additionally, I am testing the ability of mice to disperse arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi by conducting spore feeding and viability trials. Stay tuned for exciting results from both my macroecological (publication expected mid-2026) and experimental (publication expected late 2026) projects!
### 2. Soil fungi across Arctic ecological gradients
I have sampled fungal communities in soil and air in three sites near Kangerlussuaq, Greenland from 2023-2025. These sites comprise a natural gradient of ecological conditions and I'm excited to investigate differences in fungal communities!
### 3. Side-effects of management
I'm investigating the unintentional "side-effects" of management in community gardens in Boston, MA.

## Working groups
I am a member and co-technical lead of the *Fungal Dispersal Traits* working group hosted by ESIIL at CU-Boulder.
